# AudibleClock
An audible clock made for visually impaired individuals. Coded in C and created on a PIC micro controller (PIC16F1778). Time is obtained using system interrupts, and measured to be accurate using an oscilloscope. The filesystem was created by turning audio WAV files into RAW files and then into binary files. Which were then accessed through their addresses to be played. One of the more difficult parts of this project was RAM management, how this was done was by using just the bits needed for a variable, and to not use longer bits if not needed, to perform a lot of actions through arithmetic instead as there was only 2kB of data memory. And also by locking out the processor when an audio file was playing, as the buffer would soon be full causing a system crash, to sitll get accurate timing system interrupts were used. To open this code base download the zip file and open it using MPLab.
